# Workout Maker

This is a customizable Pyramid Power workout maker.

## What is a <i>Pyramid Power</i> Workout?

An example of a Pyramid power workout is:

<ol>
    <li>Exercise 1 (30 sec)</li>
    <li>Rest (15 sec)</li>
    <li>Exercise 1 (30 sec)</li>
    <li>Exercise 2 (30 sec)</li>
    <li>Rest (15 sec)</li>
    <li>Exercise 1 (30 sec)</li>
    <li>Exercise 2 (30 sec)</li>
    <li>Exercise 3 (30 sec)</li>
    <li>Rest (15 sec)</li>
</ol>

And so on...

## How does it work?

You input the time for each workout, the rest time between sets, and each exercise you plan to do. Once you click 'Start', the interval timer will show up on the screen with each exercise once you get further into the workout.
